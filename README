PI-CAM

This project uses a raspberry pi [v4-4gb], Pi-Camera v2, Coral.ai edge TPU accelerator [USB] and tensorflow lite to
perform object detection, the output is streamed out with a simple web server, and the object with the highest probability
is labeled on the video stream.


REQUIREMENTS:
Raspberry Pi v4 4GB
16gb microsd card
Coral.ai  USB Accelator Edge TPU
Pi Camera v2
